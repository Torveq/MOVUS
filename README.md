## üïπÔ∏è About The Game

In MOVUS, you are thrown into a futuristic city and must defend yourself against waves of relentless enemies. The goal is simple: **survive**. The longer you last, the higher your score. Jump across buildings, take down foes, and manage your health to become the ultimate survivor.
